> The bootstrap flow

- Django bootstrapper `manage.py` uses `core/settings.py` as the main configuration file
- `core/settings.py` loads the app magic from `.env` file
- Redirect the guest users to Login page
- Unlock the pages served by *app* node for authenticated users

<br />

## Deployment

The app is provided with a basic configuration to be executed in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), and [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/).

### [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) execution
---

The application can be easily executed in a docker container. The steps:

> Get the code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/django-dashboard-volt.git
$ cd django-dashboard-volt
```

> Start the app in Docker

```bash
$ sudo docker-compose pull && sudo docker-compose build && sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Visit `http://localhost:5005` in your browser. The app should be up & running.

<br />

### [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)
---

Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.

> Install using pip

```bash
$ pip install gunicorn
```
> Start the app using gunicorn binary

```bash
$ gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:8001 core.wsgi:application

```

Visit `http://localhost:8001` in your browser. The app should be up & running.


<br />

### [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/)
---

Waitress (Gunicorn equivalent for Windows) is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptable performance. It has no dependencies except ones that live in the Python standard library.

> Install using pip

```bash
$ pip install waitress
```
> Start the app using [waitress-serve](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/runner.html)

```bash
$ waitress-serve --port=8001 core.wsgi:application
